# Tic Tac Toe  

Feeling bored in class/ work/ home, play the classic Tic Tac Toe game instead

## Motivation

I built this game to practice building a web application from scratch and map out game logic for a simple game


### Tech/framework used  

This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. JQuery is also used to communicate with the DOM and interact with elements on the page as the user plays the game.

### Features

In this game of Tic Tac Toe, you can choose your characters, (there's no need for the old boring 'O' and 'X'), maybe you want to be a polar bear

## code   

In jQuery we often use the `$` and the `document` object is less useful. we can also `console.log`.

```javascript
const hello = function() {
  console.log('hello world');
}
```

Here is an example linking to the [W3C](https://w3c.org/).
